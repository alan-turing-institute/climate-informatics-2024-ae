## Notes

- Introduction to the team
* Resources
    * [Github repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024-ae)
    * [Reproducibility Guide in Turing Way Handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research)
    * [Reusable Code in The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/code-reuse)
    * [Documentation on the process](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024-ae)
    * [ACM Badges our badges are based on](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)

### Context
Reproducibility crisis: many scientific studies cannot be replicated or reproduced (especially in psychology and health research). This has mobilised the open source movement

AE will benefit not only author's research, but also the community as a whole.

**Climate Informatics**: A computational community in climate science. Annual Hackathons next to the conference, outputs published at EDS Book.

### Artifact Evaluation

Peer-review process of the paper: 
* Submission phase for software artifact supporting the paper
* Two reviewers will assess whether it meets AE standards
* Addendum published with the CUP paper

Why? 

Promote reporducibility
Promote increased impact in open source science
Reviewers will co-author perspective paper on AE process

Badges:
[Available] : Publically accessible DOI/ Github repo with open source license
[Functional] : Documented and complete, can be used, consistent with publication
[Reusable] : Exceeds minimal functionality, facilitates reuse and repurposing, well-documented  and -structured

### Logistics - Timeline
What to submit?
1. Overview of artifact
    * Introduction
    * Hardware requirements
    * Getting started guide
    * Step-by-step instructions
    * Reusability guide
3. Non-institutional URL pointing to: A) Single file b) Public repository
    * Non-institutional URL essential for anonymisation with reviewers
5. A hash certifying the version of the artifact

Evaluation over 5 weeks

Submission - Conversation - Implementation - Scoring - Badge

### EDS Publication
CI2024 authors have the possibility to publish at EDS Journal. 
Articles will be published in July 2024, with Data Availability Statement. 
After AE (Sep - Oct 2024), addendum 'Artifact Evaluation Award' published. Addendum will be linkable and citable.

## Questions
(please add your questions here)

- Why do you want a "non-instutional URL"? I'd have thought that there are institutional URLs (tech reports etc.) that are far more persistent than fly-by-night cloud services!
    - Answered in comments above. -> anonymisation with reviewers
- Software used for papers can also be used for consultancy. In that case, it might not be benefitial to share the software openly. We need protection of the things that we share in this case.
    - Answer: Depends on the nature of what you have. If all of the code is not sharable it would be difficult to go for the "Available" badge, but you might be able to go for the "Functional" badge if you can share your code with the reviewers (otherwise it won't work). "Reusable" might or might not be possible in that case (by whom would the software be reusable?). Think creatively (use proxys, e.g.) -> discuss with reproducibility chairs.
- Reproducibility vs generalisable -> is generalisable not more relevant for science? 
    - Adapting [ACM work](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current), where there are further badges. Work involved to go up to the "higher tiers" is massive, therefore we start with the three we mention. We are still really far from a situation where more is easily possible. -> Should also publish negative results. -> Might extend in future years.
