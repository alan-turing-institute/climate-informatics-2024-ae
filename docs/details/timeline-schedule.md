# Timeline and Process

Authors of full-papers that are accepted to the Cambridge University Press (CUP) journal proceedings will be encouraged (but not required) to submit supporting materials for Artefact Evaluation following the Climate Informatics conference, with a deadline of: 12th September.

The Artefact Evaluation Committee will review the artefacts, assessing whether they are functional (can be run) and whether the central results of the paper can be reproduced. The reviewers will interact with the authors to suggest how to improve the reproducibility if any issues are discovered.

Reviewing will take place over 5 weeks.
