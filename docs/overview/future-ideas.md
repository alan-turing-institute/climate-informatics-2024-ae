# Future ideas

Per artefact, authors and reviewers will be asked whether they would like their interactions on the artefact reviewing to be:

 * **closed** Carried out through a closed interface with reviewers anonymous;
 * **open** Carried out through GitHub/GitLab issues with reviewersâ€™ identities known.

If both parties agree to **open**, the interaction can take place in the open, e.g. with reviewers raising tickets/issues when they encounter problems, or even contributing a PR if there is a fix. If any party chooses **closed** then interactions between reviewers and authors will take place via an anonymous, closed interface, but interaction is still encouraged. Either way, this should be seen as a collaborative activity that brings benefits to both the authors and the wider community.
