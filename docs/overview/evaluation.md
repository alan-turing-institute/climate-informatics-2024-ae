# Evaluation Criteria

The artifact evaluation process is based on the [artifact Review and Badging Version 1.1](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artefact-review-and-badging-current).

## Available

- [ ] Author-created artifacts relevant to the paper are publically accessible;
- [ ] Relevant data sets are provided or are accessible where possible;
- [ ] A DOI or link to an open-source code repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided.
- [ ] Tagged version or release for the code used to produce the paper.
- [ ] An open-source license has been applied (for guidance, see https://choosealicense.com/)

For example, Zenodo can be used to deposit a snapshot of the software, providing a DOI.

## Functional

The artifacts associated with the research are documented, consistent with the publication, complete, and can be used (exercisable).

- [ ] Documented: At minimum, an inventory of artifacts is included, and sufficient description provided to enable the artifacts to be run.
- [ ] Consistent: The artifacts are relevant to the associated paper, and contribute in some inherent way to the generation of its main results.
- [ ] Complete: To the extent possible, all components relevant to the paper in question are included. (Any proprietary artifacts need not be included or data sets deemed to be too large. If any of these are required to exercise the artifact then this should be documented. Proxies for proprietary or large data should be included (e.g., alternate data sets, or smaller subsets of the data) so as to demonstrate the analysis and give evidence of its veracity.)
- [ ] Exercisable: Scripts and/or software is provided to generate the results of the associated paper (e.g, figures, tables) and can be successfully executed.

## Reusable

The artifacts associated with the paper are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. That is, they are functional, but are carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated.

- [ ] Artifacts are carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated, for example, full documentation of the API / package.
- [ ] Norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to (e.g., FAIR data and FAIR4RS).
- [ ] The artifact is packaged to enable its reused as a component in another project.
