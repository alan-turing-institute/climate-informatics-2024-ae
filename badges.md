# Badges and Evaluation Criteria

## Available

- [ ] Author-created artifacts relevant to this paper have been placed on a publiclly accessible archival repository.
- [ ] Relevant data sets are provided or are accessible where possible.
- [ ] DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided. 
- [ ] Tagged version or release for the code used to produce the paper.

For example, Zenodo can be used to deposit a snapshot of the software, providing a DOI.

## Functional

The artifacts associated with the research are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation. 
- [ ] Documented: At minimum, an inventory of artifacts is included, and sufficient description provided to enable the artifacts to be exercised.
- [ ] Consistent: The artifacts are relevant to the associated paper, and contribute in some inherent way to the generation of its main results.
- [ ] Complete: To the extent possible, all components relevant to the paper in question are included. (Proprietary artifacts need not be included. If they are required to exercise the package then this should be documented, along with instructions on how to obtain them. Proxies for proprietary data should be included so as to demonstrate the analysis.)
- [ ] Exercisable: Included scripts and/or software used to generate the results in the associated paper can be successfully executed, and included data can be accessed and appropriately manipulated.


## Reusable

The artifacts associated with the paper are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. That is, they have all the qualities of the Artifacts Evaluated â€“ Functional level, but, in addition, they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to. 

- [ ] Artifacts are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated.
- [ ] Norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to (e.g., FAIR data and FAIR4RS). 
- [ ] Be packaged to enable their reuse as a component in another project.
